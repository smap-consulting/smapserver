	   				padding-right: 0.5em;">Linking Surveys</a>
	   			</h1>
	   			<p>Forms can be linked for analysis.  For example if you have a form that collects data on assets and another form that 
	   			collects information on faults with these assets, then if they are linked, you can view the asset details while reviewing a fault, or view the 
	   			faults while reviewing an asset.</p>
	   			
	   			<h2>Setting up linked surveys</h2>
	   			<p>To allow linking to a form specify a "Unique Key" in the form settings.  This will cause a unique value to
	   			to be created for each record in the form. In a second form you can then select a question that will store
	   			this unique key.  To do this select the question property of "Linked Survey", enable the link and specify the
	   			name of the linked survey.</p>
	   			
	  			<h2>Filling in the key question</h2>
	   			<p>In our example, when you are filling in the details of a fault you will need to specify the unique key of the
	   			asset. You can do this in the following ways. How this is done will depend on the type of the question that
	   			stores the unique key.
	   			<ul>
	   				<li>Text question.  Simply write in the key.  Presumably a printout of assets and their keys will have been 
	   				made available.  Or perhaps the key will be written on the asset.</li>
	   				<li>Barcode question.  Similar to the text approach except that the key can be enter more reliably by swiping
	   				with a barcode</li>
	   				<li>Select the asset using a select_one type question</li> 
	   			</ul>
	   			
	   			<h2>Selecting the asset using select_one question</h2>
	   			
	   			<h2>Security</h2>
	   			<p>To link forms you will need to be a member of both of the projects containing the forms.</p>
	   			<p>To add a select question to a form that uses data from another form to get its unique key then you
	   			need to be a member of both of the projects containing the forms.</p>

	   				font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; position: absolute; margin-left: -1em; 
	   				padding-right: 0.5em;">Validation</a>
	   			</h1>
	   			<p>Checks are made for the following errors and warnings:</p>
	   			<ul>
	   				<li>Errors
		   				<ul>
		   					<li>An empty name </li>
		   					<li>Invalid characters, such as spaces, in the name </li>
		   					<li>A <b>question</b> name that is not unique across the entire survey </li>
		   					<li>A <b>choice</b> name that is not unique within its choice list </li>
		   					<li>A reference to another question that does not exist, 
		   						for example including the answer to another question in the label</li>
		   					<li>A mismatched number of parenthesis in a relevance, constraint or calculation</li>
		   				</ul>
		   			</li>
		   			<li>Warnings
		   				<ul>
		   					<li>A blank label (except for groups or sub forms) </li>
		   					<li>Select questions without choices </li>
		   				</ul>
		   			</li>
	   			</ul>
	   			<p>Warnings are only checked when you press the <b>validate</b> menu.<p>
	   			
	   			<h2>Validating on save</h2>
	   			<p>The editor tries to spot errors as you make them and then give immediate feedback. Hence as soon as you
	   			type an invalid character into a question name then the error message will be shown.  However for performance
	   			reasons sometimes error checking has to wait until you save the survey.  For example you might delete a question
	   			without any errors being shown but somewhere else in your survey another question refers to the deleted
	   			question. This error will only show up when you press the <b>Save</b> button or select the <b>Validate</b> option from 
	   			the	file menu</p>
	   			
	   			<h2>Reviewing errors and warnings</h2>
	   			<img src="images/help/review.jpg" class="img-responsive">
	   			<p>If an error is detected while you are changing a question (or a choice) then the question is highlighted and an 
	   			error message is shown</p>
	   			<p>If errors are found when you click the save button or validate the survey then the number of errors and 
	   			warnings are shown in the <b>toolbar</b> along with a two buttons.  If you click on the red button it will take you
	   			to the next error.  Clicking on the yellow button takes you to the next warning.
	   			
	   			<h2>Differences with validation using the xlsForm editor</h2>
	   			<ol>
	   				<li>In the online editor, question names must be unique in the entire survey.
		   				<ol>
							<li>In xlsForm the name only needs to be unique within a form For example a begin 
							repeat can have a question with the same name as is in the main form.</li>
							<li>However if you attempt to refer to the question using the ${…} syntax then xlsForm will 
							report an error if it is not unique in the entire survey.</li>  
							<li>It is also probably better that names are forced to be unique across all forms as this will 
							reduce confusion during analysis.  Hence the tighter restriction adopted by the Smap online editor.</li>
							<li>However this means that if you have an existing form with two questions that have the same 
							name then you will not be able to edit it online unless you delete one of the questions.</li>
						</ol>

	   			</h1>
	   			<h2>Publishing</h2>
	   			<p>When you start creating a new survey form it is <b>not</b> published.  However as soon as you submit the
	   			first completed survey from fieldTask or webForms is is considered to be published.  This means data has
	   			been collected for the survey and some additional restrictions will be placed on the editor.</p>
	   			<ul>
	   			<li>You will not be able to change the name of a question as this name identifies the column in the results
	   			table that holds the answers for that question.</li>
	   			<li>You will not be able to change the type of a question as Smap server can't store two different types of
	   			data in a single results column</li>
	   			<li>You can delete a question but its not really gone as the results gathered for that question are not deleted.
	   			Hence you won't be able to create another question with the same name as the deleted question unless it is also the
	   			same type, (text integer etc).
	   			</ul>
	   			<p>If you have modified a survey part way through collecting real data then you will just have to put up with the
	   			above restrictions.  However you will usually want to submit data while testing a survey so that you can see how the
	   			results will look during analysis. After you have done this you can <b>un</b>-publish the survey.</p>
	   			<h2>Un-Publish</h2> 
	   			<p>To un-publish you just need to delete all the data that has been submitted. (Careful here).</p><p>This is done in the 
	   			analysis dashboard where you can create a table panel for the survey, review the data that is there, then select the 
	   			<b>aside</b> using the <b><</b> button and press delete</p>
	   			<p>Once the survey has been unpublished the editing restrictions will be lifted</p>

	   			<p>You can edit or create forms on a small device such as a phone.  However because of the small

	   			<li>The drag and drop feature to move questions and choices is currently not available on devices that use touch.</li>
	   			<li>The <b>toolbar</b> with the types of question you can add will not be shown.  You will have to add a
	   			question by pressing on one of the blue <b>add question</b> bars.  This will create a question of
	   			type <b>text</b> at the location you selected.  You can then press the <b>type</b> icon, on the question,
	   			to change the question type.</li>
	   			<li>The button bar at the top of the screen will be much smaller.  Buttons, such as <b>save</b> will instead be

	   			<p>The online editor is beta software and will stay that way for some months while the bugs are found and 
	   			fixed.  An editor allows for many different ways of doing a task hence its impossible to test everything.
	   			If something does go wrong you can try the following</p>
	   			
	   			<ul>
	   			<li>Check the <b>changes</b> page by selecting the file menu and then ""changes".  This should show all the
	   			saved changes that you have made and which version of the survey they apply to.</li>
	   			<li>If you are not editing a form that already has submitted data then you can export as an "edited xlsForm".
	   			  Then continue the editing in the xlsForm editor and upload when the problem is fixed</li>
	   			<li>Contact Smap for support.  We will be very interested in the problem if it was caused by a bug in the editor and
	   			will fix it free of charge.	If you just made a mistake and want it to be reversed thenwe can probably help with that if you
	   			have a support contract or for a one off fee</li>
